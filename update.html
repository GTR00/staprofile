                            <p>   After editing multiple drafts, the Profile Committee is nearing its goal to produce a final draft to present to the Vestry on Monday night, June 25.  Information compiled from the parish wide survey, the Focus Groups, the Sunday morning Round Table discussions, and individual interviews are being compiled to write the profile document.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        A Town Hall meeting involving the Cathedral’s city-wide community outreach partners and their St. Andrew’s volunteer counterparts was held on June 13 in the Parish Hall. In addition to the Profile Committee, about 30 people attended. We hope this is the beginning of more coordination and brainstorming among the commissions. The purpose was to gather information for the profile document about the Cathedral’s outreach interests and efforts. A member of the Mayor’s staff presented a short overview of the City’s Strategic Plan as a backdrop for our work in meeting the needs of all citizens.  The commissions represented were:  the Angel Tree; the Breakfast Club; CONTACT, the Crisis Line; the Good Samaritan Families in Crisis; Grace House; Habitat for Humanity; Harbor House, Honduras Medical Mission, Meals on Wheels, the McLean Fletcher Center; Mississippi Food Network; Mississippi Light Collaborative; Mission Mississippi; Operation Shoestring; Refill Cafe; Springboard to Opportunities; Stewpot Community Services; and Working Together Jackson.

                            <p>The members of the Profile Committee, elected by the Vestry: Elizabeth Bush, Kelly Allin Butler, Noel Didla, Nan Graves Goodman, Henderson (Hinky) Hall, Bill Nation, and Sarah Stripp have been working hard each Monday night for two months to prepare the written profile which will be used in the search for the new Dean of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Cathedral. The profile will describe the unique and wonderful makeup of the St. Andrew’s community as a Diocesan Cathedral, and will also reflect specific desires for attributes, abilities, and gifts to be found in the new Dean. Numerous opportunities have been designed for parishioners to be involved and to contribute information for the written profile:
                                     </p>
                                    
                                    <ol>
                                        <li class="pb-3">All parishioners have been invited to sign up for Focus Groups, scheduled to meet in members’ homes between April 24 and May 4. Day and night meetings are offered. Identical questions will be presented in each group, which will be led by a trained facilitator. Focus Group content, which will be gathered by a recorder from the Profile Committee, will be used in the compilation of the written profile itself. Sign up sheets can be found in the Rotunda, as well as on-line at standrews.ms/thesearchforadean. Please get involved by joining one of these groups.</li>
                                        <li class="pb-3">In addition, a parish wide electronic survey has also been emailed to all communicants, and paper copies will also be available upon request. The Profile Committee requests parish wide involvement by every member on this survey which will provide specific material to be used in the written profile of the Cathedral. The survey takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. <a href="standrews.ms/profilesurvey"> Online Survey</a></li>
                                        <li class="pb-3">A “Comment Box” is located in the Rotunda where members may insert a completed flyer with answers to five specific questions. The flyer is included with each Sunday’s service bulletin. The answered flyer may also be placed in the offering plate.

                                            </li>
                                        <li class="pb-3">Finally, a short drama will be produced by the “Profile Players” in the Parish Hall during the Sunday school hour on May 20. The drama will creatively and humorously reflect on the work of the Profile Committee and prepare parishioners for the next step in the process of the search for a new Dean as the Profile Committee hands over its work to the Search Committee. </li>

                                            The Vestry has appointed a seven-member Profile Committee to gather the data and develop the profile that will be used in the search for a Dean. After meeting with Canon Paul Stephens, who reviewed the expectations, resources, and timeline for the process leading to the election of the next Dean, the Vestry decided that the committee would be made up of seven people representative of a cross section of the Cathedral community and who possess a variety of gifts and graces that will be necessary in listening, analyzing, writing, illustrating, and publishing the profile. Fifty-two persons were considered, half of which were suggested in response to the invitation for input from the Cathedral community. From those fifty-two, twenty-one were on the final list from which the seven were chosen.</p>

                                 <p>In the invitation for suggestions of names to be considered, we included a description of the work of the Profile Committee and a description of some of the gifts and graces the Vestry would be looking for in the membership. <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/f8472dfb001/8423af66-1a9f-402b-9345-3f47b633d182.pdf">Click here to read those descriptions</a>.
                                 The Profile Committee will have its initial meeting on Saturday, February 24. At that meeting, Canon Stephens will provide training, a convener will be chosen, and a meeting schedule will be established.</p>

                                 <p>Thanks to these faithful members for answering the call to serve. Please remember them in your prayers and be prepared to participate in the survey and conversations they will soon host. Their goal will be to have gathered the necessary information by the end of May so that the finished and approved profile can be made public by late summer. Your attention and participation will help the committee accomplish their mission on schedule.</p>
