                            <p>   After editing multiple drafts, the Profile Committee is nearing its goal to produce a final draft to present to the Vestry on Monday night, June 25.  Information compiled from the parish wide survey, the Focus Groups, the Sunday morning Round Table discussions, and individual interviews are being compiled to write the profile document.</p>

                                        A Town Hall meeting involving the Cathedral’s city-wide community outreach partners and their St. Andrew’s volunteer counterparts was held on June 13 in the Parish Hall. In addition to the Profile Committee, about 30 people attended. We hope this is the beginning of more coordination and brainstorming among the commissions. The purpose was to gather information for the profile document about the Cathedral’s outreach interests and efforts. A member of the Mayor’s staff presented a short overview of the City’s Strategic Plan as a backdrop for our work in meeting the needs of all citizens.  The commissions represented were:  the Angel Tree; the Breakfast Club; CONTACT, the Crisis Line; the Good Samaritan Families in Crisis; Grace House; Habitat for Humanity; Harbor House, Honduras Medical Mission, Meals on Wheels, the McLean Fletcher Center; Mississippi Food Network; Mississippi Light Collaborative; Mission Mississippi; Operation Shoestring; Refill Cafe; Springboard to Opportunities; Stewpot Community Services; and Working Together Jackson.

                            <p>The members of the Profile Committee, elected by the Vestry: Elizabeth Bush, Kelly Allin Butler, Noel Didla, Nan Graves Goodman, Henderson (Hinky) Hall, Bill Nation, and Sarah Stripp have been working hard each Monday night for two months to prepare the written profile which will be used in the search for the new Dean of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Cathedral. The profile will describe the unique and wonderful makeup of the St. Andrew’s community as a Diocesan Cathedral, and will also reflect specific desires for attributes, abilities, and gifts to be found in the new Dean. Numerous opportunities have been designed for parishioners to be involved and to contribute information for the written profile:
                                     </p>
                                    
                                    <ol>
                                        <li class="pb-3">All parishioners have been invited to sign up for Focus Groups, scheduled to meet in members’ homes between April 24 and May 4. Day and night meetings are offered. Identical questions will be presented in each group, which will be led by a trained facilitator. Focus Group content, which will be gathered by a recorder from the Profile Committee, will be used in the compilation of the written profile itself. Sign up sheets can be found in the Rotunda, as well as on-line at standrews.ms/thesearchforadean. Please get involved by joining one of these groups.</li>
                                        <li class="pb-3">In addition, a parish wide electronic survey has also been emailed to all communicants, and paper copies will also be available upon request. The Profile Committee requests parish wide involvement by every member on this survey which will provide specific material to be used in the written profile of the Cathedral. The survey takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. <a href="standrews.ms/profilesurvey"> Online Survey</a></li>
                                        <li class="pb-3">A “Comment Box” is located in the Rotunda where members may insert a completed flyer with answers to five specific questions. The flyer is included with each Sunday’s service bulletin. The answered flyer may also be placed in the offering plate.

                                            </li>
                                        <li class="pb-3">Finally, a short drama will be produced by the “Profile Players” in the Parish Hall during the Sunday school hour on May 20. The drama will creatively and humorously reflect on the work of the Profile Committee and prepare parishioners for the next step in the process of the search for a new Dean as the Profile Committee hands over its work to the Search Committee. </li>

                                            The Vestry has appointed a seven-member Profile Committee to gather the data and develop the profile that will be used in the search for a Dean. After meeting with Canon Paul Stephens, who reviewed the expectations, resources, and timeline for the process leading to the election of the next Dean, the Vestry decided that the committee would be made up of seven people representative of a cross section of the Cathedral community and who possess a variety of gifts and graces that will be necessary in listening, analyzing, writing, illustrating, and publishing the profile. Fifty-two persons were considered, half of which were suggested in response to the invitation for input from the Cathedral community. From those fifty-two, twenty-one were on the final list from which the seven were chosen.</p>

                                 <p>In the invitation for suggestions of names to be considered, we included a description of the work of the Profile Committee and a description of some of the gifts and graces the Vestry would be looking for in the membership. <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/f8472dfb001/8423af66-1a9f-402b-9345-3f47b633d182.pdf">Click here to read those descriptions</a>.
                                 The Profile Committee will have its initial meeting on Saturday, February 24. At that meeting, Canon Stephens will provide training, a convener will be chosen, and a meeting schedule will be established.</p>

                                 <p>Thanks to these faithful members for answering the call to serve. Please remember them in your prayers and be prepared to participate in the survey and conversations they will soon host. Their goal will be to have gathered the necessary information by the end of May so that the finished and approved profile can be made public by late summer. Your attention and participation will help the committee accomplish their mission on schedule.</p>

                        <p>Two months ago, the Vestry invited parishioners to submit names for consideration for service on
                            the Dean Search Committee. The Vestry then added additional names to the list and established
                            the qualifications for those who serve; members must be confirmed communicants in good standing
                            in the Cathedral Parish and have a current pledge. The membership of the committee must also
                            be as diverse as possible and represent a cross section of the parish. The Wardens contacted
                            everyone who met the qualifications to determine their interest in serving.</p>
                        <p>At last month's meeting, the Vestry decided to appoint nine members to the committee, including one
                            member of the Vestry, from the list of qualified and willing communicants. After prayerful deliberation,
                            those to be invited to serve were identified and the Wardens contacted them once again to confirm
                            their willingness to serve. From those names, the Vestry has chosen nine communicants for appointment
                            to the committee.</p>
                        <p>The members of the committee are Carol Penick (convener), Linda Bass, Anne Dulske, Missye Martin,
                            Pat McNease, Ed Oliver, John Sewell, Alex Sullivan, and Katharine Surkin.</p>
                        <p>The Dean Search Committee will begin its work right away. After a period of reviewing applications,
                            interviews, reference and background checks, and mutual discernment with applicants, they will
                            submit their recommendations to the Vestry, which will complete the search process and elect
                            a Dean and Rector, whom the Bishop will then be asked to call. From the beginning, the committee

living in Flora, Mississippi, for 27 years.</p>

<p>Carol says, “For 27 years we’ve seen good times and not-so-good times, and today it feels like we’re
entering an exciting period of positive change. I look forward to the next stage in the life
of our church – The vestry is strong; the congregation is ready for this search; and the profile
for the next Dean will lead us in the right direction. It’s an exciting time to be a member of
the St. Andrew’s Cathedral!"</p>

Ed Oliver
</figcaption>
</div>

<p>Ed Oliver was reared in the Roman Catholic Church but left when he was twenty years old because, as he says, “I could not reconcile my understanding of a loving and accepting God as revealed in the Gospels with the church's view of my authentic self.” After a self-imposed twenty-year exile from organized religion, Ed was Received by Bishop Gray Jr. at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on May 14th, Mother's Day, of 1991.</p>

<p>Since joining St. Andrew's, Ed has been an active member, which has included serving on several Inquirer's Classes, two Catechumenate sessions, Every Member Canvas, Chalice Bearer, Member of the Vestry, Branches Leader, Human Sexuality Committee Convener, Founding Board Member of Grace House, St. Andrew's AIDS Care Team, Breakfast Club, annual Greening coordinator, and Front Desk Volunteer, and has just become a member of the newly organized Evangelism Commission.</p>

<p>After careers in retail, the hospitality industry, advertising and mental health Ed found himself at a crossroads related to the death of his father and a call to some sort of ministry dealing with life and death issues. In what might be called a “midlife crisis” Ed went to nursing school and eventually found a career at UMMC on a GYN Oncology and Surgery unit. Caring for the sick and in some cases dealing with patients and their families in the midst of the death was rewarding, and in many cases heart breaking. He retired from UMMC in June of last year.</p>

<p>Socially, Ed enjoys a small circle of close friends and many acquaintances from various walks of life and experiences. After several relationships that did not have the longevity he had hoped for Ed currently lives alone, except for my furry four-footed dictator, in Belhaven. </p>
