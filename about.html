                        <p>Two months ago, the Vestry invited parishioners to submit names for consideration for service on
                            the Dean Search Committee. The Vestry then added additional names to the list and established
                            the qualifications for those who serve; members must be confirmed communicants in good standing
                            in the Cathedral Parish and have a current pledge. The membership of the committee must also
                            be as diverse as possible and represent a cross section of the parish. The Wardens contacted
                            everyone who met the qualifications to determine their interest in serving.</p>
                        <p>At last month's meeting, the Vestry decided to appoint nine members to the committee, including one
                            member of the Vestry, from the list of qualified and willing communicants. After prayerful deliberation,
                            those to be invited to serve were identified and the Wardens contacted them once again to confirm
                            their willingness to serve. From those names, the Vestry has chosen nine communicants for appointment
                            to the committee.</p>
                        <p>The members of the committee are Carol Penick (convener), Linda Bass, Anne Dulske, Missye Martin,
                            Pat McNease, Ed Oliver, John Sewell, Alex Sullivan, and Katharine Surkin.</p>
                        <p>The Dean Search Committee will begin its work right away. After a period of reviewing applications,
                            interviews, reference and background checks, and mutual discernment with applicants, they will
                            submit their recommendations to the Vestry, which will complete the search process and elect
                            a Dean and Rector, whom the Bishop will then be asked to call. From the beginning, the committee
                            and the Vestry will be in regular communication with the Office of the Bishop.</p> </div>

<p>When George and Carol moved to Mississippi in 1990, the first church they visited was St. Andrew’s,
and they never considered another option. She is grateful for the very warm welcome! As a parishioner

<p> George and Carol have two adult children. Their daughter, Holladay, lives in New Orleans and works
for General Electric, using her creative and technology skills to improve GE products. Their
son, Robert, and his new wife, Anna, live in Nashville where he works for UBS and she is a therapist.</p>

<p>The Penicks have two black labs and a calico cat. With them, they moved last year into Jackson after
living in Flora, Mississippi, for 27 years.</p>

<p>Carol says, “For 27 years we’ve seen good times and not-so-good times, and today it feels like we’re
entering an exciting period of positive change. I look forward to the next stage in the life
of our church – The vestry is strong; the congregation is ready for this search; and the profile
for the next Dean will lead us in the right direction. It’s an exciting time to be a member of
the St. Andrew’s Cathedral!"</p>

Ed Oliver
</figcaption>
</div>

<p>Ed Oliver was reared in the Roman Catholic Church but left when he was twenty years old because, as he says, “I could not reconcile my understanding of a loving and accepting God as revealed in the Gospels with the church's view of my authentic self.” After a self-imposed twenty-year exile from organized religion, Ed was Received by Bishop Gray Jr. at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on May 14th, Mother's Day, of 1991.</p>

<p>Since joining St. Andrew's, Ed has been an active member, which has included serving on several Inquirer's Classes, two Catechumenate sessions, Every Member Canvas, Chalice Bearer, Member of the Vestry, Branches Leader, Human Sexuality Committee Convener, Founding Board Member of Grace House, St. Andrew's AIDS Care Team, Breakfast Club, annual Greening coordinator, and Front Desk Volunteer, and has just become a member of the newly organized Evangelism Commission.</p>

<p>After careers in retail, the hospitality industry, advertising and mental health Ed found himself at a crossroads related to the death of his father and a call to some sort of ministry dealing with life and death issues. In what might be called a “midlife crisis” Ed went to nursing school and eventually found a career at UMMC on a GYN Oncology and Surgery unit. Caring for the sick and in some cases dealing with patients and their families in the midst of the death was rewarding, and in many cases heart breaking. He retired from UMMC in June of last year.</p>

<p>Socially, Ed enjoys a small circle of close friends and many acquaintances from various walks of life and experiences. After several relationships that did not have the longevity he had hoped for Ed currently lives alone, except for my furry four-footed dictator, in Belhaven. </p>
