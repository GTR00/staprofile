                    Meet the Search Committee
                </h1>
             
                <p>The members of the committee are Carol Penick (convener), Linda Bass, Anne Dulske, Missye Martin, Pat McNease,
                    Ed Oliver, John Sewell, Alex Sullivan, and Katharine Surkin.</p>
                <p>The Dean Search Committee will begin its work right away. After a period of reviewing applications, interviews,
                    reference and background checks, and mutual discernment with applicants, they will submit their recommendations
                    to the Vestry, which will complete the search process and elect a Dean and Rector, whom the Bishop will
                    then be asked to call. From the beginning, the committee and the Vestry will be in regular communication
                    with the Office of the Bishop.</p>

                <p>We are excited about this committee and believe they will represent us well. Read more about them below.
                    They have a big task ahead of them, so please pray daily for them as well as the Vestry throughout the
                    process.</P>

                                When George and Carol moved to Mississippi in 1990, the first church they visited was St. Andrew’s, and they never considered another option. She is grateful for the very warm welcome! As a parishioner at St. Andrew’s Carol has served as a Sunday School teacher, Greeter, Meals on Wheels cook, Flower Guild member, Tuesday morning breakfast server, Habitat worker, and a variety of other roles.</p>
         
        <p>
            Professionally, Carol has worked for many years as a teacher, a fundraiser for non-profits, and for the past ten years as the Executive Director of the Women’s Foundation of Mississippi. In January 2016 she retired. Her husband, George, worked in the world of philanthropy for about 30 years. He has recently retired from his 10-year career as Head of School at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School.
        </p>
         
        <p>
            George and Carol have two adult children. Their daughter, Holladay, lives in New Orleans and works for General Electric, using her creative and technology skills to improve GE products. Their son, Robert, and his new wife, Anna, live in Nashville where he works for UBS and she is a therapist.
        </p>
         
        <p>
            The Penicks have two black labs and a calico cat. With them, they moved last year into Jackson after living in Flora, Mississippi, for 27 years.
        </p>
         
        <p>Carol says, “For 27 years we’ve seen good times and not-so-good times, and today it feels like we’re entering an exciting period of positive change. I look forward to the next stage in the life of our church – The vestry is strong; the congregation is ready for this search; and the profile for the next Dean will lead us in the right direction. It’s an exciting time to be a member of the St. Andrew’s Cathedral!"
