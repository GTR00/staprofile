                Colin A. P. (Pat) McNease was born on June 12, 1939. Pat is a graduate of Murrah High School (1957) and the University of Missouri School of Journalism (1961). He served his country as an officer in the United States Marine Corps (1961-1965).

            <p>
                Ed Oliver was reared in the Roman Catholic Church but left when he was twenty years old because, as he says, “I could not reconcile my understanding of a loving and accepting God as revealed in the Gospels with the church's view of my authentic self.” After a self-imposed twenty-year exile from organized religion, Ed was Received by Bishop Gray Jr. at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on May 14th, Mother's Day, of 1991.</p>
 
<p>
    Since joining St. Andrew's, Ed has been an active member, which has included serving on several Inquirer's Classes, two Catechumenate sessions, Every Member Canvas, Chalice Bearer, Member of the Vestry, Branches Leader, Human Sexuality Committee Convener, Founding Board Member of Grace House, St. Andrew's AIDS Care Team, Breakfast Club, annual Greening coordinator, and Front Desk Volunteer, and has just become a member of the newly organized Evangelism Commission.
</p>
 
<p>
    After careers in retail, the hospitality industry, advertising and mental health Ed found himself at a crossroads related to the death of his father and a call to some sort of ministry dealing with life and death issues. In what might be called a “midlife crisis” Ed went to nursing school and eventually found a career at UMMC on a GYN Oncology and Surgery unit. Caring for the sick and in some cases dealing with patients and their families in the midst of the death was rewarding, and in many cases heart breaking. He retired from UMMC in June of last year.
</p>
 
<p>Socially, Ed enjoys a small circle of close friends and many acquaintances from various walks of life and experiences. After several relationships that did not have the longevity he had hoped for Ed currently lives alone, except for my furry four-footed dictator, in Belhaven.
