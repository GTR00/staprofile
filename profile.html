                                <p>St. Andrew’s Episcopal Cathedral, a downtown parish located in the middle of Mississippi’s
                                    capitol city, Jackson, is seeking a new dean. Established in 1839, this parish of 1,218
                                    communicants seeks a priest who will guide, teach, empower and walk with us through our
                                    next period of ministry. Designated in 1966 as Cathedral of the Diocese of Mississippi,
                                    now led by the Right Reverend Brian R. Seage, this strong and resilient parish endeavors
                                    to create a space where all who enter will experience the overwhelming love of God in
                                    Jesus Christ.</p>
                            </div>


                            <p>The Cathedral’s location places us in the very center of state government. Across the street
                                is the Governor’s Mansion. Within a few blocks you will find the State Capitol, Federal Courthouse
                                and other government buildings. Our location also places us in the midst of a wealth of renowned
                                museums, musical, literary and cultural events, academic institutions, artistic performances
                                and outstanding restaurants. Nearby are the University Medical Center, MS Baptist Medical
                                Center, Batson Children’s Hospital, and other outstanding Healthcare Facilities. </p>
                            <p>The Cathedral’s location placed us at the center of Mississippi’s most difficult historical sites
                                and periods related to slavery, segregation and racism. Always a place of radical welcome,
                                we continue to take leadership roles in addressing these painful issues.
                            </p>
                            <p>St. Andrew’s offers many and varied opportunities for worship. Four services on Sundays include
                                Rite I at 7:30 a.m., Rite II at 8:45 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. as well as Community Evensong at
                                5:00. Noonday Eucharist is offered each weekday. Healing services, memorial services and
                                seasonal observances are staples of our life together. Inspired preaching and teaching enrich
                                our common journey and equip us for ministry.</p>
                            <p>A host of lay-led ministries enlivens this parish inside and out. Through guilds, commissions,
                                committees, and study groups, active parishioners are a central part of liturgical life,
                                formation opportunities and the support and care of communicants and neighbors alike. Known
                                as founder of several well established ministries throughout Jackson, St. Andrew’s continually
                                provides leadership and support to organizations which strive to assist the most vulnerable
                                in our city and metro area.</p>
                            <p>This parish is a strong family that celebrates each other’s accomplishments and nurtures one
                                another through times of deep pain. We are now emerging from two years of healing wounds
                                and are ready to embrace a new leader…one who will love, challenge and inspire us as we seek
                                to be Christ’s hands at work in the world.</p>
                            <p>Is something urging you to learn more? If so, read on. Perhaps you are being nudged to discern
                                if a common path is unfolding before you and St. Andrew’s Cathedral Parish.</p>

                    <p>St. Andrew’s Church was established as a parish with eight recorded communicants in 1839, and became
                        a parish of the Diocese of Mississippi in 1843. St. Andrew’s has been located across from The Mississippi
                        Governor’s Mansion in the heart of the capital city since 1869. The first service in the new nave
                        was held on All Saints’ Day the next year. The first vested choir sang at the Easter service in 1898,
                        to the glory of God and the delight of more than 600 communicants. From this southeast corner of
                        Capitol and West Street we have offered an Episcopal response through the decades to a deeply southern,
                        but ever-changing city.
                    </p>
                    <p>St. Andrew’s has a history of spawning new institutions to meet needs as they occur. Our parishioners
                        established the first Boy Scout Troop in the state. We assisted in the formation of the first African-American
                        mission in the diocese which is still Jackson’s thriving St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in west Jackson.
                        In the decades to follow, St. Andrew’s would assist in the planting of four more missions that are
                        parishes today: St. Columb’s, St. James’, St. Phillip’s, and St. Alexis.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dr. Vincent Franks served as rector from 1947-1959, during which time St. Andrew’s Episcopal School was
                        founded. Dr. Frank’s wife, Adele Franks, served as the first headmistress. The school, which opened
                        in the parish hall in 1947, with 42 students, had been the vision of committed communicants Sherwood
                        Wise and Reynolds Cheney, and it became the first independent school in the area. From its beginning,
                        the school was committed to welcoming students of all races and ethnicities when other schools in
                        the area did not. A succession of school moves have occurred: in early 1950, to a house on North
                        State Street, and in 1966, to Old Canton Road. In 1985, the middle and upper schools moved to a new
                        campus in Ridgeland, Mississippi, immediately north of Jackson. The lower school still remains on
                        Old Canton Road in Jackson. The Cathedral dean serves as an ex-officio member of the school board,
                        and three Episcopal chaplains, two of whom are on the Cathedral staff, serve as spiritual leaders
                        at the school, conducting weekly chapel services. St. Andrew’s Episcopal School is known today for
                        its high quality of academics and for its multi-cultural and racially diverse student body. Twenty
                        percent of the 1,172 students enrolled in the past academic year were Episcopalians.</p>

                        <strong>Our Role as Flagship</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>For close to two centuries, St. Andrew’s has held regular Sunday services for its communicants, visitors,
                        and those just passing through. In our capacity as cathedral parish, we welcome the role of hosting
                        diocesan services and events. We understand the importance of being involved in diocesan leadership
                        through various leadership roles. We have an obligation to model meaningful and expansive liturgy,
                        responsible stewardship, and generous outreach.</p>
                    <p>Through the decades we have been a place of welcome, comfort, and dialogue:</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>So how did we become a Cathedral?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1966, then Bishop Coadjutor, The Right Reverend John Maury Allin, put in motion a plan to establish
                        St. Andrew’s as a cathedral parish during the tenure of The Right Reverend Duncan Montgomery Gray,
                        Sr. (the first of three Bishop Grays). (Allin succeeded Gray, Sr. as the 6
                        <sup>th</sup> Bishop of Mississippi, and was later elected as the twenty-third presiding bishop of The
                        Episcopal Church.)
                    </p>
                    <p>The rector of St. Andrew’s during this period, Christoph Keller, would establish an important role for
                        the soon-to-be Cathedral by responding to the racial tensions of the time. The day following Medgar
                        Wiley Evers’ funeral in Jackson, he welcomed a group of African-American worshippers into the Sunday
                        service (June 16, 1963). His courage was joined by lay leadership, as recorded in this well-known
                        personal account by Anne Moody.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            <em>“When we walked inside, we were greeted by two ushers who stood at the rear. ‘May we help you?’
                                one said. ‘Yes, I said. ‘We would like to worship with you today. ‘Will you sign the guest
                                list, please, and we will show you to your seats,’ said the other. I stood there for a good
                                five minutes before I was able to compose myself. I had never prayed with white people in
                                a white church before…we were then escorted to two seats behind the other two girls in our
                                team. We had all gotten in…. It was as normal as any church service…. When the services were
                                over the minister invited us to visit again. He said it as if he meant it, and I began to
                                have a little hope.”</em>

                    <p>Six successive deans would follow, contributing distinct and significant gifts in each of their respective
                        tenures. A couple of these tenures also presented serious challenges to congregational unity and
                        membership, but the parish weathered these difficult periods and moved forward.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Resilient and Ready</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>While every aspect of our history need not define who we are now, external and internal events have shaped
                        us.
                    </p>
                    <p>The seventh, and most recent, dean accomplished quite a lot in his tenure. The parish successfully completed
                        a $3.1million capital campaign that transformed and repurposed many parts of our historic footprint.
                        He significantly swelled the ranks of young adults and young families as regular members. And he
                        initiated the still-popular, Dean’s List (a strictly-social, monthly gathering of men over roasted
                        meat and beverage of one’s choice, with proceeds benefiting general outreach). These are recognizable
                        and positive legacies.</p>
                    <p>His time as dean of St. Andrew’s Cathedral, however, ended abruptly with his resignation in July 2016.
                        Subsequently, in January 2017, he was deposed from the ordained ministry of The Episcopal Church
                        for violations of standards of conduct. This event was deeply distressing to St. Andrew’s parishioners,
                        clergy, and staff. Our bishop lived fully into his episcopal role as chief pastor to heal hurts by
                        engaging outside professional resources and being available for questions.</p>
                    <p>A supportive interim period (July 2016 through July 2017) followed with the pastoral talents of David
                        Elliot, a longtime and beloved priest in the diocese, and Interim Dean Ron Pogue, whose special training
                        and managerial talents have guided us since August 2017. During this interim period, the wardens
                        and vestry have taken several specific actions that have moved us to a new place of strength and
                        stability:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>New governance procedures (by-laws and fiscal controls) have been put in place to ensure transparency
                                and accountability. Fully vetted, these measures were enthusiastically adopted by the congregation.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>New human resources guidelines have been developed and approved by the vestry.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Reinstatement of the commission structure (each with a designated vestry liaison) and reinvigorated
                                guilds provide a solid framework for brainstorming and developing programs in Evangelism,
                                Christian Formation, Liturgy and Music, Pastoral Care, Community Partnership, Stewardship,
                                and Parish Life.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>There are well-functioning committees that advise the vestry on Finance, Personnel, Buildings
                                and Grounds, Endowment, and Investment.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>An emphasis on stewardship yielded a record-breaking high point in pledging history since 1998.</p>

                    <p>Mississippi’s history includes the disenfranchisement and pernicious segregation that fueled the Civil
                        Rights Movement and centered Jackson in the national context with the murder of NAACP Field Secretary,
                        Medgar Wiley Evers. But new light shines on significant recognitions and institutions that Jackson
                        and Mississippi have established to heal wounds and relationships:

                    <p>A college town, metro-Jackson is a temporary academic home for a time to thousands of young people. Almost
                        50 percent of Jackson’s population is under the age of 35. There is a lot of momentum among community
                        and cultural organizations propelling Jackson forward. The food scene in Jackson has grown and expanded
                        tremendously in the last five years. There are numerous festivals, races, and local theaters boasting
                        local and Actor’s Equity talent.</p>
                    <p>Jackson neighborhoods also sponsor outdoor festivals and gatherings throughout the year. A major downtown
                        redevelopment plan is underway with new artists’ lofts, a renovated King Edward Hotel, the ever-popular
                        (especially among parishioners) Mayflower Café, and soon-to-open Corner Market. The buildings adjacent
                        to St. Andrew’s are being renovated to create apartments.
                    </p>
                    <p>New and progressive stories are being written by a new generation of Jacksonians. Our Cathedral is well-positioned
                        in downtown Jackson’s comeback as a residential area.</p>

                        <strong>Adult Formation</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Presently, Christian formation is delivered in multiple ways at St. Andrew’s. The Reverend Katie Bradshaw,
                        Canon for Lifelong Formation and Mission, in her second year with us, brings great energy and intellect
                        to all aspects of spiritual formation. Her talents lend well to planning for all age groups. Sunday
                        school classes for all generations and cross-generations provide a wide variety of offerings from
                        the study of Biblical text to exploration of contemporary issues. Several are lay led.</p>
                    <p>There are a few long-standing groups that meet regularly on Sunday or a weekday.</p>
                    <p>There have been periodic special programs planned and executed by parishioners such as the “Moving Toward
                        Forgiveness” series focused on the unfinished work of racial reconciliation. Speakers in the Adele
                        Franks Crispin Journey Series such as Rabbi Rami Shapiro on the Sacred Art of Lovingkindness, The
                        Reverend Becca Stephens from Thistle Farms, The Reverend Lynnsay Buehler on centering prayer, and
                        The Reverend Ed Bacon on spiritual formation have been well received.</p>
                    <p>Recent Lenten Study books have included Richard Rohr’s
                        <em>Falling Upward (</em>Harper Collins, 2011), Atul Gawande’s
                        <em>Being Mortal (</em>Metropolitan Books, 2014), and Gerald May’s
                        <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em> (Harper Collins, 2004).</p>

                        <p>
                            <em>“To be able to share and confide in such an intimate setting, to question and grow together,
                                is very safe, meaningful, and needed.” St. Andrew's Parishioner</em>

                    <p>Participation in small groups brings to communicants of St. Andrew’s cannot be overstated. They seem
                        to be the place where the community continues to be bound together.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the ever-popular Sunday morning Dean’s Forum, once a staple of our formation diet, became more
                        irregular during the recent transitions. Parishioners voiced very strong support for its return.
                        We want a dean who can teach!</p>

                        <strong>Children’s Formation</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Through its history, St. Andrew’s has enjoyed strong leadership for children’s programming. There are
                        talented volunteers and a Coordinator for Children’s Ministries nurturing our littlest ones in the
                        faith and being nurtured by them. There is a real desire to expand children’s offerings, involve
                        them more directly in the worship service, and appreciate the gift of ministry they give to us as
                        adults.</p>
                    <p>Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, now in its thirtieth year, gives children ages three to nine an introduction
                        to the life-long study of Jesus’ teachings. A new volunteer-led program is underway for 4Th and 5th
                        graders. The Bible-based curriculum is designed to provide a good next step for children as they
                        grow beyond Catechesis.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Book of Common Prayer gives the Church authentic ways to stretch tradition and to create alternative
                        ways to integrate children fully into worship. And, when we take care to do this, the children are
                        clear about what it means to them:</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>“I like going to the Cathedral and seeing the light shining through the stained glass and feeling
                            happy.”</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>[USE OTHER QUOTES]</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>At present, children participate in “Children’s Chapel” during services where they learn the structure
                        of the service and are exposed to the weekly Gospel reading. When they join the adult congregation
                        during the Eucharist, the children are invited to sit within the altar rail to experience the preparation
                        of the table up close.</p>
                    <p>Vacation Bible School (VBS), a perennial favorite, is another avenue for shared ministry between children
                        and adults. VBS has been a great opportunity to invite new families to come and see, so they will
                        stay and learn. This summer’s VBS attendance exceeded 70 children, a strong indication that the spiritual
                        formation of young children may be one of the most potent areas for growth at the Cathedral.</p>

                        <strong>Youth Opportunities and Challenges</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Youth ministry has tough competition in the scheme of things. Especially as a downtown church, we are
                        challenged to offer adequate programming. Our youth attend a variety of schools, both public and
                        private in the tri-county area, so it is difficult to develop bonds and friendships when their only
                        encounters with staff and with each other are on Sundays and Wednesday nights. Monthly serving at
                        Stewpot and serving as acolytes continue to be regular and important ministries for our young people.</p>
                    <p>Since the capital campaign, the repurposed downstairs youth space is much larger and has been considerably
                        improved. We are committed to building a program that sustains engagement, grows them spiritually,
                        lifts them into leadership roles, and makes the church relevant in their young and future lives.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            <em>“Younger people today are exposed to far more diversity and have a lot more questions about faith.
                                It's rare for people to remain Christians just because their parents were at this point.
                                If we want to remain relevant, we have to be a space that is open to questions and provides
                                a community that supports people who have a lot of questions. There has to be room for that
                                to be okay in order for people to grow and to also provide an attractive community that future
                                generations will want to be a part of.” St. Andrew's Parishioner</em>

                    <p>“When Jesus sends us, together, to the places he himself intends to go, he goes with us. He goes with
                        us down the road into our neighborhoods and communities, to open doors, to cross thresholds, to spend
                        time in others’ rooms. He goes with us to break bread together, to talk and listen and pray, to heal
                        the sin-sickness of our separation from those to whom Jesus would go, and they bring Jesus to us.
                        It is shared need. It is mutual care.”</p>

                        <strong>A Shared Priesthood</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Pastoral care is very important to us, and we see it as a shared responsibility. There is strong agreement
                        about the value and capacity of our current Canon for Pastoral Care, The Reverend Jennifer Deaton.
                        Now in her seventh year, she is the kind and steadfast face of pastoral care both inside and beyond
                        the walls of St. Andrew’s.</p>
                    <p>We see ourselves sharing in this ministry as a strong network of pastoral care for each other and for
                        our neighbors. This is the essence of our shared priesthood.</p>
                    <p>Many, many parishioners carry out quiet discipleship within and beyond the established guilds. Parishioners
                        are the hands and feet of Jesus in daily intercessions, meal preparation, rides for homebound friends
                        to Sunday services, and weekday appointments.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to unanticipated crises, that call for and receive an immediate response, there are a number
                        of ongoing pastoral care ministries where parishioners can touch a heart and lend a hand.</p>

                        <strong>Reaching Out</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>St. Andrew’s has a rich history of identifying and responding to the needs of fellow citizens in the
                        City of Jackson and other areas of the state and world where poverty, disaster, or oppression rob
                        individuals and communities of health and freedom. From our earliest history, the people of St. Andrew’s
                        have sought to minister to those around us, as far back as 1855, during the yellow fever epidemic.
                        During the 1980s, St. Andrew’s and its parishioners founded or co-founded six new outreach ministries
                        within six years. All but one of these ministries still actively are serving the needs of our neighbors,
                        and many others have been added.</p>

                        <p>
                                St. Andrew’s was a key facilitator
                                In the founding and continuing support of these ministries
                        </p>




                    <p>Representatives of these partnerships participated in a recent town hall meeting, reflecting a broad
                        spectrum of ages, from young people in their late twenties to communicants who have been involved
                        for more than four decades—
                        <em>since</em> their twenties! A representative from the mayor’s office shared the city’s strategic plan
                        with the group to establish a context for all of the work we are doing.</p>
                    <p>Participants acknowledged the vital leadership and stewardship role St. Andrew’s has played for many
                        decades. For some, our presence and support “have made all the difference.” Service providers and
                        parishioners spoke eloquently about the challenges.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            <em>“At the end of our worship Episcopalians are sent out into the world. That’s why these ministries
                                are so critical. These (founding) dates are so important. They show that when there is a
                                need, we respond! This conversation is important, so that when we call a new dean, he or
                                she will empower us to this ministry.” St. Andrew's Parishioner</em>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>There was a clear call for St. Andrew’s to convene these service providers on a regular basis and to
                        develop a clearinghouse of services. There is a sense that many require services from more than one
                        provider. Also, possibly there are duplications in services. St. Andrew’s could help frame an ecosystem
                        where fewer gaps or duplications in services exist, and economic justice becomes the value lens that
                        pushes our work forward.

                        <strong>Ways We Use Our Building for Outreach</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>St. Andrew’s has a beautiful and large building in downtown Jackson that also has been used to support
                        the community in a variety of ways. Every Tuesday morning, we open our doors for the Tuesday Morning
                        Breakfast Club where volunteers serve and share a hot meal and coffee with our neighbors experiencing
                        homelessness.</p>
                    <p>We have hosted meetings and events for partners and community organizations including the Human Rights
                        Campaign, Overeaters Anonymous, Springboard To Opportunities, and others. According to survey results,
                        there is a desire within our congregation to see our building utilized more and remain open throughout
                        the week for the community to be able to use in a variety of ways.</p>
                    <p>Most recently, we have agreed to reactivate our sponsorship of an Alcoholic Anonymous group on a regular,
                        weekly basis, a move championed by many in the congregation.</p>
                    <p>Beyond traditional outreach programs, St. Andrew’s has also been known to support cultural programs throughout
                        the city.</p>

                    <p>DRAFT Mission</p>
                    <p>The Cathedral Parish of St. Andrew is the mother church of the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi and the
                        Seat of its Bishop. Living into our baptismal covenant, we promise to respect the dignity of every
                        human being. We are a unifying center of authentic faith, diversity, intellectual discovery, and
                        community leadership.</p>
                    <p>Out theology supports the values of community, hospitality, education, pastoral care, evangelism, outreach,
                        and resource development. These values undergird our mission which is to provide an environment where
                        everyone might know and experience the unconditional love of God in Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>Vision</p>
                    <p>The Cathedral of St. Andrew is a house of prayer rooted in the Episcopal tradition. Our vision is to
                        offer a place of meeting and safety in which everyone might know the unconditional love of God in
                        Jesus Christ. Our desire is to be an authentic community centered in common worship where spirituality
                        is deepened, diversity embraced, and where people might find wholeness, strength, and healing. As
                        an urban parish, we seek to welcome, engage, and empower the people of Jackson and beyond.
