                            <p>The Episcopal Cathedral of St. Andrew, a downtown parish located in the middle of Mississippi’s
                                capital city, Jackson, is seeking a new dean. Established in 1839, this parish of 1,218 communicants
                                seeks a priest who will guide, teach, empower and walk with us through our next period of
                                ministry. Designated in 1966 as The Cathedral of the Diocese of Mississippi, now led by the
                                Right Reverend Brian R. Seage, this strong and resilient parish endeavors to create a space
                                where all who enter will experience the overwhelming love of God in Jesus Christ.</p>

                            

                            <p>The Cathedral’s location places us in the very center of state government. Across the street
                                is the Governor’s Mansion. Within a few blocks one will find the State Capitol, Federal Courthouse
                                and other government buildings. Our location also places us in the midst of a wealth of renowned
                                museums, musical, literary and cultural events, academic institutions, artistic performances
                                and outstanding restaurants. Nearby are the University of Mississippi Medical Center and
                                other notable healthcare facilities.
                            </p>

                            <p>Historically the Cathedral’s downtown location placed us at the center of Mississippi’s struggles
                                related to slavery, segregation and racism. We continue to take leadership roles in addressing
                                these painful issues.
                            </p>
                            <p>St. Andrew’s offers many and varied opportunities for worship. Four services on Sundays include
                                Rite I at 7:30 a.m., Rite II at 8:45 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and a Community Evensong at 5:00.
                                The Holy Eucharist is offered each weekday. Healing services, memorial services and seasonal
                                observances are staples of our life together. Inspired preaching and teaching enrich our
                                common journey and equip us for ministry.</p>
                            <p>A host of lay-led ministries enlivens this parish inside and out. Through guilds, commissions,
                                committees, and study groups, active parishioners are a central part of liturgical life,
                                formation opportunities and the support and care of communicants and neighbors alike. Known
                                as founder of several well established ministries throughout Jackson, St. Andrew’s continually
                                provides leadership and support to organizations which strive to assist the most vulnerable
                                in our city and metro area.</p>

                            <p>This parish is a strong community that celebrates each other’s accomplishments and nurtures one
                                another through times of difficulty. We are now emerging from two years of healing wounds
                                and are ready to embrace a new leader…one who will love, challenge and inspire us as we seek
                                to be Christ’s hands at work in the world.</p>

                            <p>

                            <p>Our recent parish canvass revealed a congregation that sees itself as “a broad church. open-minded,
                                deeply spiritual, and committed to each other and the wider community.” We embrace different
                                backgrounds in race, culture, sexual orientation, soci-economic status and with different
                                approaches to spirituality.</p>

                            <p>We are diverse in our political opinions and in our theological opinions, while being tolerant
                                and respectful of one another. We come as sisters and brothers to the altar rail. We aspire
                                to be a place of radical welcome.</p>

                            <p>Even though St. Andrew’s has a history of welcoming the stranger and standing against injustices,
                                our congregation does not reflect the racial or socio-economic diversity of the city or those
                                who are marginalized. We seek to understand what this means for us as the "Cathedral in the
                                City." Not just any city, we are a city in the heart of the South and one that stands to
                                be recognized nationally for its reconciling posture and bold preaching of the Gospel.</p>
                            <p>Diversity in the church is important, especially to the youth of today and the generations that
                                follow. How can we be true to our deeply Anglican liturgical identity and practices, while
                                also working to be more inviting and accessible to other cultures and races?</p>

                            </h3>




                            <p>Worship is the center of our life together at St. Andrew’s and the liturgy is a compelling and
                                unifying experience for parishioners. We use all forms of Rites I and II during Sunday morning
                                services, as well as for baptisms, marriages, funerals, and other special services.
                                <em>Enriching Our Worship</em> and
                                <em>Wonder, Love, and Praise add</em> variety. There is an openness to alternate liturgies, other
                                traditions and prayers, and more inclusive and expansive language is being introduced.</p>

                                and music within the liturgical framework set out in the Book of Common Prayer.

                            <p>The laity plays a significant role in every service. There is a strong corps of well-supervised
                                acolytes, trained at a level befitting our Anglican-style services. Talented Altar Guild
                                and Flower Guild members perform their duties with joy and often under the radar, but their
                                holy gifts are much appreciated by all of us. Ushers and greeters form a strong, cohesive
                                team that offers hospitality and guidance every time the Cathedral opens its doors. Readers
                                and chalice bearers are present at all Sunday services and special services.</p>
                            <p>The full complement of lay liturgical support and music is also present for special mid-week
                                services, including funerals. The Cathedral’s thoughtfully designed columbarium, All Souls
                                Walk, is an integral part of our faith life. Located on the west side of the building, this
                                tree-lined walkway is a place of beauty, solace, and holiness.</p>

                            <p>Throughout our history, music has been an integral part of our worship and our spiritual formation.
                                The Cathedral is known for its superb music, organized choirs, and individuals of extraordinary
                                musical talent. It is often the music that first draws newcomers into our midst. Our organist
                                and choirmaster, Jessica Nelson, enables a strong and vibrant music program.</p>
                            <p>Our mainstay has been music in the Anglican tradition. We have seperate choirs for the 8:45 a.m.
                                and 11:00 a.m. services. Although the two choirs have different memberships and often rehearse
                                different anthems, the style between the two services is fairly similar. Periodically we
                                have had a Children’s Choir, and there is a desire to build this component of our worships
                                we are calling for more participation by children in worship.

                            <p>St. Andrew’s Church was established as a mission in 1839 with eight recorded communicants, and
                                was admitted to the Diocese 1843. The congregation worshiped in various places until it acquired
                                its first building located at the southeast corner of President and Amite Streets, in 1850.
                                This building was destroyed by fire during the Civil War in 1863. A second church building
                                was erected 1870 at the southeast corner of Capitol and Congress. The first vested choir
                                sang at the Easter servcice in 1898 and the rector, the Reverend Arthur B. Howard, commented,
                                "We almost thought we heard the angels sing." That building was outgrown and a third building
                                was built in 1903, just a block away, on the south side of Capitol Street directly opposite
                                the Govern's home. Established as the Cathedral of the Diocese in 1966, this beautiful building
                                is in use today, with several additional buildings having been added through the years. From
                                this historic site, we have offered an Episcopal response through the decades to a deeply
                                souther, but ever-changing city.

                            <p>St. Andrew’s has a history of fostering new institutions to meet needs as they occur. Our parishioners
                                established the first Boy Scout Troop in the state. We assisted in the formation of the first
                                African-American mission in the diocese St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in west Jackson. In the
                                decades to follow, St. Andrew’s would assist in the planting of four more missions that are
                                parishes today: St. Columb’s, St. James’, St. Phillip’s, and St. Alexis.

                                Dr. Vincent Franks served as rector from 1947-1959. During that time St. Andrew’s Episcopal School was founded. Adele Franks,
                                wife of the rector, served as the fist headmistress. The school, which opened in the Parish
                                Hall in 1947, became the first independent school in the area. From its beginning, the school
                                was committed to welcoming students of all races and ethnicities when other schools in the
                                area did not. The Cathedral dean serves as an ex-officio member of the school board. Three
                                Episcopal chaplains, who are also Associate Clergy at the Cathedral, serve as spiritual leaders,
                                teaching, counseling, and conducting weekly chapel services. St. Andrew’s Episcopal School
                                is known today for its high quality of academics and for its multi-cultural and racially
                                diverse student body. Twenty percent of the 1,172 students enrolled in the past academic
                                year were Episcopalians.

                            </p>
                            <p>In 1966, during the tenure of The Right Reverend Duncan Montgomery Gray, Sr. (the first of three
                                Bishop Grays), then Bishop Coadjutor, The Right Reverend John Maury Allin, put in motion
                                a plan to establish St. Andrew’s as a cathedral parish. (Allin succeeded Gray, Sr. as the
                                6
                                <sup>th</sup> Bishop of Mississippi, and was later elected as the twenty-third presiding bishop
                                of The Episcopal Church.)
                            </p>
                            <p>The rector of St. Andrew’s during this period, the Reverend Christoph Keller, would establish
                                an important role for the soon-to-be Cathedral by responding to the racial tensions of the
                                time. The day following Medgar Wiley Evers’ funeral in Jackson, he welcomed a group of African-American
                                worshippers into the Sunday service (June 16, 1963). His courage was joined by lay leadership,

                                            ‘May we help you?’ one said. ‘Yes, I said. ‘We would like to worship with you

                                            said the other. I stood there for a good five minutes before I was able to compose

                                            the minister invited us to visit again. He said it as if he meant it, and I began

                            <p>Six successive deans would follow, contributing distinct and significant gifts in each of their
                                respective tenures. A couple of these tenures also presented serious challenges to congregational
                                unity and membership, but the parish weathered these difficult periods and moved forward.</p>



                            <p>The seventh, and most recent, dean accomplished quite a lot in his tenure. The parish successfully
                                completed a $3.1 million capital campaign that transformed and repurposed many parts of our
                                historic footprint. The ranks of young adults and young families as regular members significantly
                                expanded during this time. The still-popular, Dean’s List, (a monthly gathering of men for
                                dinner) was begun, with proceeds benefiting general outreach. These are recognizable and
                                positive legacies.</p>
                            <p>His time as dean of St. Andrew’s Cathedral, however, ended abruptly with his resignation in July
                                2016. Subsequently, in January 2017, he was deposed from the ordained ministry of The Episcopal
                                Church for violations of standards of conduct. This event was deeply distressing to St. Andrew’s
                                parishioners, clergy, and staff. Our bishop lived fully into his episcopal role as chief
                                pastor to heal hurts by engaging outside professional resources and being available for questions.</p>

                            <p>The Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi was established in 1826. Its jurisdiction serves the entire
                                state. We are part of Province IV of The Episcopal Church’s organizational structure.

                            <p>Jackson was incorporated as a city in 1821. Located today at the intersection of Interstate-55
                                and Interstate-20, Jackson has been dubbed “The Crossroads of the South.” From January to
                                April, downtown Jackson overflows with legislators, their staff, lobbyists, and other political
                                enthusiasts and leaders. State government is the largest employer followed by the University
                                of Mississippi Medical Center. Nissan, Toyota, and Continental Tire have Mississippi plants,
                                and the Stennis Space Center and Ingalls Shipyard are just a few hours away.</p>
                               

                            <p>Jackson is rich in arts, artists, and cultural history, as well as educational institutions:</p>

                            <p>Presently, Christian formation is delivered in multiple ways at St. Andrew’s. The Reverend Canon
                                Katie Bradshaw, Canon for Lifelong Formation and Mission, in her second year with us, brings
                                great energy and intellect to all aspects of spiritual formation. Her talents lend well to
                                planning for all age groups. Sunday school classes for all generations and cross-generations
                                provide a wide variety of offerings from the study of Biblical text to exploration of contemporary
                                issues. Many of our offerings are led by parishoners.</p>

                            <p>There are a few long-standing groups that meet regularly on Sunday or a weekday, including for
                                example: Education for Ministry, Enneagram Study, and Theology and Literature.</p>

                            <p>There have been periodic special programs planned and executed by parishioners such as the “Moving
                                Toward Forgiveness” series focused on the unfinished work of racial reconciliation. Speakers
                                in the Adele Franks Crispin Journey Series such as Rabbi Rami Shapiro on the Sacred Art of
                                Lovingkindness, The Reverend Becca Stevens from Thistle Farms, The Reverend Lynnsay Buehler
                                on centering prayer, and The Reverend Ed Bacon on spiritual formation have been well received.</p>

                            <p>Participation in small groups is a meaningful method of formation at St. Andrew’s, and we expect

                            <p>Finally, the popular Sunday morning Dean’s Forum, once a staple of our formation programs, became
                                more irregular during the recent transitions. Parishioners voiced very strong support for

                                ones in the faith and being nurtured by them. There is a real desire to expand children’s
                                offerings, involve them more directly in the worship service, and appreciate the gift of
                                ministry they give to us.

                            <p>Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, now in its thirtieth year at St. Andrew's, gives children ages
                                three to nine an introduction to the life-long study of Jesus’ teachings. A new volunteer-led
                                program is underway for 4Th and 5th graders. The Bible-based curriculum is designed to provide
                                a good next step for children as they grow beyond Catechesis.

                            <p>During services at present, children participate in “Children’s Chapel” where they learn the
                                structure of the service and are exposed to the weekly Gospel reading. When they join the
                                adult congregation during the Eucharist, the children are invited to sit within the altar
                                rail to experience the preparation of the table up close.</p>

                            <p>Vacation Bible School (VBS), a perennial favorite, is another avenue for shared ministry between

                                see, so they will stay and learn. This summer’s VBS attendance exceeded 70 children, a strong
                                indication that the spiritual formation of young children may be one of the most potent areas

                            <p>Youth ministry has tough competition with the wide span of other activites in which our youth
                                are engaged. Also, they attend a number of different schools, both public and private in
                                the tri-county area, so developing a strong bond among them is challenging, especially when
                                their encounters are Sundays and Wednesdays nights. Part-time youth ministers and adult volunteers
                                have sustained the program in recent years. In that time, youth ministry mainstays have been
                                acolyting and serving lunch at Stewpot, a local feeding ministry, twice a month.</p>

                                Additionally, after a lengthy search process, we hired a part-time youth minister in the
                                summer of 2018. While there is a desire to eventually make this position full-time, we're
                                hopeful that in the meantime his enthusiasm and dedication will help us revive the youth
                                program. We are committed to building a program that sustains engagement, among participants,
                                fosters their spiritual growth, encourages them to take on leadership roles within the church,
                                and makes the church relevant for them, now and always.

                                disaster, and oppression. We have ministered to those around us as far back as 1855, when
                                yellow fever hit Jackson. In the 1980s, St. Andrew’s parishioners founded or co-founded six
                                new outreach ministries within six years.</p>

                            <p>
                                During the tenure of the last Dean, however, outreach funding decreased significantly, and the commission supporting these
                                ministries was dismantled. Interim Dean Elliott oversaw the reinstatement of the lay-led
                                commissions and partially restored funding.

                                With new vision and mission statements in place, the commission has accomplished a great deal in 2018. We recently created
                                a new grant-application process for our community partners, and also hosted a town hall meeting
                                for them, where they exchanged ideas and a representative from the mayor’s office shared
                                the city’s strategic plan. Participants acknowledged the vital role St. Andrew’s has played
                                in their work. For some, our presence and support “have made all the difference.”

                                The town hall meeting resulted in a clear call for St. Andrew’s to convene our community partners regularly. We are now working
                                to do just that in order to create a stronger network of services for those in need

                            <p>Representatives of these partnerships participated in a recent town hall meeting, reflecting
                                a broad spectrum of ages, from young people in their late twenties to communicants who have
                                been involved for more than four decades—
                                <em>since</em> their twenties! A representative from the mayor’s office shared the city’s strategic
                                plan with the group to establish a context for all of the work we are doing.</p>
                            <p>Participants acknowledged the vital leadership and stewardship role St. Andrew’s has played for
                                many decades. For some, our presence and support “have made all the difference.” Service
                                providers and parishioners spoke eloquently about the challenges.</p>

                            <p>There was a clear call for St. Andrew’s to convene these service providers on a regular basis
                                and to develop a clearinghouse of services. There is a sense that many require services from
                                more than one provider. Also, possibly there are duplications in services. St. Andrew’s could
                                help frame an ecosystem where fewer gaps or duplications in services exist, and economic
                                justice becomes the value lens that pushes our work forward.

                            <p>St. Andrew’s has a beautiful and large building in downtown Jackson that also has been used to
                                support the community in a variety of ways. Weely, we open our doors for
                                the Tuesday Morning Breakfast Club where volunteers serve and share a hot meal and coffee
                                with our neighbors experiencing homelessness.
                            </p>
                            <p>We have hosted meetings and events for partners and community organizations including the Human
                                Rights Campaign, Overeaters Anonymous, Springboard To Opportunities, and others. According
                                to survey results, there is a desire within our congregation to see our building utilized
                                more and remain open throughout the week for the community to use in a variety of ways.</p>
