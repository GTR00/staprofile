                            <p>Episcopal Cathedral of St. Andrew, a downtown parish located in the middle of Mississippi’s capitol
                                city, Jackson, is seeking a new dean. Established in 1839, this parish of 1,218 communicants
                                seeks a priest who will guide, teach, empower and walk with us through our next period of
                                ministry. Designated in 1966 as Cathedral of the Diocese of Mississippi, now led by the Right
                                Reverend Brian R. Seage, this strong and resilient parish endeavors to create a space where
                                all who enter will experience the overwhelming love of God in Jesus Christ.</p>

                            <div class="float-lg-left">
                                <img class='img-fluid profile-incopy-img-left-ls' src='img/StAndrewsCathedraGovMan.jpg'>
                            </div>

                            <p>The Cathedral’s location places us in the very center of state government. Across the street
                                is the Governor’s Mansion. Within a few blocks one will find the State Capitol, Federal Courthouse
                                and other government buildings. Our location also places us in the midst of a wealth of renowned
                                museums, musical, literary and cultural events, academic institutions, artistic performances
                                and outstanding restaurants. Nearby are the University Medical Center, Mississippi Baptist
                                Medical Center, Batson Children’s Hospital, and other outstanding healthcare facilities.
                                </p>
                            <p>The Cathedral’s location placed us at the center of Mississippi’s most difficult historical sites
                                and periods related to slavery, segregation and racism. Always a place of radical welcome,
                                we continue to take leadership roles in addressing these painful issues.
                            </p>
                            <p>St. Andrew’s offers many and varied opportunities for worship. Four services on Sundays include
                                Rite I at 7:30 a.m., Rite II at 8:45 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and a Community Evensong at 5:00.
                                Noonday Eucharist is offered each weekday. Healing services, memorial services and seasonal
                                observances are staples of our life together. Inspired preaching and teaching enrich our
                                common journey and equip us for ministry.</p>
                            <p>A host of lay-led ministries enlivens this parish inside and out. Through guilds, commissions,
                                committees, and study groups, active parishioners are a central part of liturgical life,
                                formation opportunities and the support and care of communicants and neighbors alike. Known
                                as founder of several well established ministries throughout Jackson, St. Andrew’s continually
                                provides leadership and support to organizations which strive to assist the most vulnerable
                                in our city and metro area.</p>
                            <p>This parish is a strong family which celebrates each other’s accomplishments and nurtures one
                                another through times of deep pain. We are now emerging from two years of healing wounds
                                and are ready to embrace a new leader…one who will love, challenge and inspire us as we seek
                                to be Christ’s hands at work in the world.</p>
                            <p>You are invited to read on and learn more about who we are. Consider the significance of our
                                rich history and bright future. Learn what brings us joy and life as a community of followers
                                of Jesus Christ. Perhaps a common path is unfolding between you and the Cathedral of St.
                                Andrew's? Come and see. </p>

                            <p>Our mainstay has been music in the Anglican tradition. We have seperate choirs for the 8:45 a.m.
                                and for the 11:00 a.m. services. Although the two choirs have different memberships and often
                                rehearse different anthems, the style between the two services is fairly similar. Periodically
                                we have had a Children’s Choir, and there is a desire to build up this component of our worships

                            <p>St. Andrew’s Church was established as a parish with eight recorded communicants in 1839, and
                                became a parish of the Diocese of Mississippi in 1843. St. Andrew’s has been located across
                                from The Mississippi Governor’s Mansion in the heart of the capital city since 1869. The
                                first service in the new nave was held on All Saints’ Day the next year. The first vested
                                choir sang at the Easter service in 1898, to the glory of God and the delight of more than
                                600 communicants. From this southeast corner of Capitol and West Street we have offered an
                                Episcopal response through the decades to a deeply southern, but ever-changing city.

                            <p>St. Andrew’s has a history of spawning new institutions to meet needs as they occur. Our parishioners
                                established the first Boy Scout Troop in the state. We assisted in the formation of the first
                                African-American mission in the diocese which is still Jackson’s thriving St. Mark’s Episcopal
                                Church in west Jackson. In the decades to follow, St. Andrew’s would assist in the planting
                                of four more missions that are parishes today: St. Columb’s, St. James’, St. Phillip’s, and
                                St. Alexis.

                            <p>Dr. Vincent Franks served as rector from 1947-1959, during which time St. Andrew’s Episcopal
                                School was founded. Dr. Frank’s wife, Adele Franks, served as the first headmistress. The
                                school, which opened in the parish hall in 1947, with 42 students, had been the vision of
                                committed communicants Sherwood Wise and Reynolds Cheney, and it became the first independent
                                school in the area. From its beginning, the school was committed to welcoming students of
                                all races and ethnicities when other schools in the area did not. A succession of school
                                moves have occurred: in early 1950, to a house on North State Street, and in 1966, to Old
                                Canton Road in Jackson. In 1985, the middle and upper schools moved to a new campus in Ridgeland,
                                Mississippi, immediately north of Jackson. The lower school still remains on Old Canton Road.
                                The Cathedral dean serves as an ex-officio member of the school board, and three Episcopal
                                chaplains, two of whom are on the Cathedral staff, serve as spiritual leaders at the school,
                                conducting weekly chapel services. St. Andrew’s Episcopal School is known today for its high
                                quality of academics and for its multi-cultural and racially diverse student body. Twenty
                                percent of the 1,172 students enrolled in the past academic year were Episcopalians.</p>

                            <p>The rector of St. Andrew’s during this period, Christoph Keller, would establish an important
                                role for the soon-to-be Cathedral by responding to the racial tensions of the time. The day
                                following Medgar Wiley Evers’ funeral in Jackson, he welcomed a group of African-American
                                worshippers into the Sunday service (June 16, 1963). His courage was joined by lay leadership,
                                as recorded in this well-known personal account by Anne Moody.</p>

                                            ‘May we help you?’ one said. ‘Yes, I said. ‘We would like to worship with you

                                            said the other. I stood there for a good five minutes before I was able to compose
                                            myself. I had never prayed with white people in a white church before…we were
                                            then escorted to two seats behind the other two girls in our team. We had all
                                            gotten in…. It was as normal as any church service…. When the services were over
                                            the minister invited us to visit again. He said it as if he meant it, and I began
                                            to have a little hope.</p>

                                respective tenures. A couple of these tenures also presented serious challenges to congregational
                                unity and membership, but the parish weathered these difficult periods and moved forward.</p>

                            <p>While every aspect of our history need not define who we are now, external and internal events
                                have shaped us.
                            </p>
                            <p>The seventh, and most recent, dean accomplished quite a lot in his tenure. The parish successfully
                                completed a $3.1million capital campaign that transformed and repurposed many parts of our
                                historic footprint. He significantly swelled the ranks of young adults and young families
                                as regular members. And he initiated the still-popular, Dean’s List (a strictly-social, monthly
                                gathering of men over roasted meat and beverage of one’s choice, with proceeds benefiting
                                general outreach). These are recognizable and positive legacies.</p>
                            <p>His time as dean of St. Andrew’s Cathedral, however, ended abruptly with his resignation in July
                                2016. Subsequently, in January 2017, he was deposed from the ordained ministry of The Episcopal
                                Church for violations of standards of conduct. This event was deeply distressing to St. Andrew’s
                                parishioners, clergy, and staff. Our bishop lived fully into his episcopal role as chief
                                pastor to heal hurts by engaging outside professional resources and being available for questions.</p>
                            <p>A supportive interim period (July 2016 through July 2017) followed with the pastoral talents
                                of David Elliot, a longtime and beloved priest in the diocese, and Interim Dean Ron Pogue,
                                whose special training and managerial talents have guided us since August 2017. During this
                                interim period, the wardens and vestry have taken several specific actions that have moved
                                us to a new place of strength and stability:

                                Bradshaw, Canon for Lifelong Formation and Mission, in her second year with us, brings great
                                energy and intellect to all aspects of spiritual formation. Her talents lend well to planning
                                for all age groups. Sunday school classes for all generations and cross-generations provide
                                a wide variety of offerings from the study of Biblical text to exploration of contemporary

                            <p>There are a few long-standing groups that meet regularly on Sunday or a weekday.</p>
                            <p>There have been periodic special programs planned and executed by parishioners such as the “Moving

                                underway for 4Th and 5th graders. The Bible-based curriculum is designed to provide a good

                                adult congregation during the Eucharist, the children are invited to sit within the altar

                            <p>Vacation Bible School (VBS), a perennial favorite, is another avenue for shared ministry between

                                see, so they will stay and learn. This summer’s VBS attendance exceeded 70 children, a strong

                            <p>Youth ministry has tough competition in the scheme of things. Especially as a downtown church,
                                we are challenged to offer adequate programming. Our youth attend a variety of schools, both
                                public and private in the tri-county area, so it is difficult to develop bonds and friendships
                                when their only encounters with staff and with each other are on Sundays and Wednesday nights.
                                Monthly serving at Stewpot and serving as acolytes continue to be regular and important ministries
                                for our young people.</p>
                            <p>Since the capital campaign, the repurposed downstairs youth space is much larger and has been
                                considerably improved. We are committed to building a program that sustains engagement, grows
                                them spiritually, lifts them into leadership roles, and makes the church relevant in their
                                young and future lives.</p>

                                    about faith. It's rare for people to remain Christians just because their parents were
                                    at this point. If we want to remain relevant, we have to be a space that is open to questions
                                    and provides a community that supports people who have a lot of questions. There has
                                    to be room for that to be okay in order for people to grow and to also provide an attractive

                                and pray, to heal the sin-sickness of our separation from those to whom Jesus would go, and

                            <p>Pastoral care is very important to us, and we see it as a shared responsibility. There is strong
                                agreement about the value and capacity of our current Canon for Pastoral Care, The Reverend
                                Jennifer Deaton. Now in her seventh year, she is the kind and steadfast face of pastoral
                                care both inside and beyond the walls of St. Andrew’s.</p>
                            <p>We see ourselves sharing in this ministry as a strong network of pastoral care for each other
                                and for our neighbors. This is the essence of our shared priesthood.</p>
                            <p>Many, many parishioners carry out quiet discipleship within and beyond the established guilds.
                                Parishioners are the hands and feet of Jesus in daily intercessions, meal preparation, rides
                                for homebound friends to Sunday services, and weekday appointments.

                                a number of ongoing pastoral care ministries where parishioners can touch a heart and lend
                                a hand.</p>

                            <p>St. Andrew’s has a rich history of identifying and responding to the needs of fellow citizens
                                in the City of Jackson and other areas of the state and world where poverty, disaster, or
                                oppression rob individuals and communities of health and freedom. From our earliest history,
                                the people of St. Andrew’s have sought to minister to those around us, as far back as 1855,
                                during the yellow fever epidemic. During the 1980s, St. Andrew’s and its parishioners founded
                                or co-founded six new outreach ministries within six years. All but one of these ministries
                                still actively are serving the needs of our neighbors, and many others have been added.</p>

                            <p>Representatives of these partnerships participated in a recent town hall meeting, reflecting
                                a broad spectrum of ages, from young people in their late twenties to communicants who have
                                been involved for more than four decades—
                                <em>since</em> their twenties! A representative from the mayor’s office shared the city’s strategic
                                plan with the group to establish a context for all of the work we are doing.</p>
                            <p>Participants acknowledged the vital leadership and stewardship role St. Andrew’s has played for
                                many decades. For some, our presence and support “have made all the difference.” Service
                                providers and parishioners spoke eloquently about the challenges.</p>

                            <p>There was a clear call for St. Andrew’s to convene these service providers on a regular basis
                                and to develop a clearinghouse of services. There is a sense that many require services from
                                more than one provider. Also, possibly there are duplications in services. St. Andrew’s could
                                help frame an ecosystem where fewer gaps or duplications in services exist, and economic
                                justice becomes the value lens that pushes our work forward.

                                to survey results, there is a desire within our congregation to see our building utilized
                                more and remain open throughout the week for the community to be able to use in a variety

                                St. Andrew’s has a strong financial position with opportunities for growth. The 2018 annual operating budget is $1.4 million,
                                and the 2018 stewardship campaign yielded an increase of over 20% in total pledges. The Cathedral
                                also saw a significant increase in new pledges and in the median pledge. Past generosities
                                have provided a roughly $2 million endowment that is designated for facility repairs, outreach,
                                and other purposes.

                                    $96,000 as of June 2018 and we are on track to significantly reduce or eliminate it altogether

                            <p>The Cathedral Parish of St. Andrew is the mother church of the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi
                                and the Seat of its Bishop. Living into our baptismal covenant, we promise to respect the
                                dignity of every human being. We are a unifying center of authentic faith, diversity, intellectual
                                discovery, and community leadership.</p>
                            <p>Out theology supports the values of community, hospitality, education, pastoral care, evangelism,
                                outreach, and resource development. These values undergird our mission which is to provide
                                an environment where everyone might know and experience the unconditional love of God in
                                Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <p>Vision</p>
                            <p>The Cathedral of St. Andrew is a house of prayer rooted in the Episcopal tradition. Our vision
                                is to offer a place of meeting and safety in which everyone might know the unconditional
                                love of God in Jesus Christ. Our desire is to be an authentic community centered in common
                                worship where spirituality is deepened, diversity embraced, and where people might find wholeness,
                                strength, and healing. As an urban parish, we seek to welcome, engage, and empower the people
                                of Jackson and beyond.
